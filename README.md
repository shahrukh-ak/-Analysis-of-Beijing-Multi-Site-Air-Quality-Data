# -Analysis-of-Beijing-Multi-Site-Air-Quality-Data
The data set Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality Data provided in the UCI Machine Learning
Repository includes hourly air pollutants data from 12 nationally-controlled air-quality
monitoring sites. The air-quality data are from the Beijing Municipal Environmental
Monitoring Center. The meteorological data in each air-quality site are matched with the

## Objectives:
- Import the data from Wanliu and Tiantan stations in R and create a single data frame.<br>
- Display the PM10 values by creating a side-by-side box plot for both stations.<br>
- Test for significance difference in PM10 values in Wanliu and Tiantan.
